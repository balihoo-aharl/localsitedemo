# Local Site Demo

This is a wrapper to build demos for Balihoo's standard localsite templates. The template should be placed in the site directory.

The links are configured by passing an object literal to the BlhSalesDemo class constructor. See main.js, lines 86 - 111

## TODO

* Move BLhSalesDemo config from an object argument to a JSON file.
* Setup color picker drawer.
    * Animated drawer.
    * Color picker element constructors.
    * Cookies to preserve settings on refresh.
    * Preset color schemes.
